  <p>I specialize in modern cryptography, computer and web security, privacy of data processing.<!---do research spanning cryptography, post-quantum and lattice-based security, multi-party protocols, privacy preserving data mining.---></p>
  <p>I received my PhD in Computer Science from Stanford University advised by Prof. Dan Boneh. I am currently part of <a href="https://www.novi.com/">Novi</a> crypto research team.</p>
  <p>Favorite crypto-projects of mine are:
