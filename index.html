  <p>I do research spanning cryptography, post-quantum and lattice-based security, multi-party protocols, privacy preserving data mining.</p>
  <p>I received my PhD in Computer Science from Stanford University advised by Dan Boneh.</p>
  <p>My largest crypto-project were:
    <ul>
      <li>Frodo Key Exchange</li>
      <li>Attribute Based Encryption from Lattices</li>
      <li>Privacy Preserving Linear Regression on Hundreds of Millions of Users</li>
      <li>Privacy Preserving Matrix Factorization</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
<!--	<p>Before that I received my MSc from the University of the Russian Academy of Sciences focusing on Computational Complexity and BSc from the Polytechnical University in St. Petersburg, focusing on Computer Algebra.</p>
	<p>I did 2 research internships doing projects in cryptography: Google, Technicolor, a software engineering inernships in JetBrains working on smart development environments and a research internship in Transas designing Computer Graphics algorithms for marine and aviation training systems.</p> -->
  <p>After finishing PhD I traveled for 1 year with my family on bicycles through South America.</p>
